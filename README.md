# HI,
This repository showcases the path I took to learn html-css. 
Feel free to clone, learn & use everything you find useful here. 

## ROADMAP!
Sorry, I can't provide you a roadmap to learn anything. 
Find your own path. 

## CSS3
I know, css is hard. 
Practice, practice and things will still be tough. 
But you will get your job done. 

## HTML5
Easy to learn. 
Not so easy to remember semantic meaning of every element. 
So, don't memorize. I didn't. 

## GIVEUP
Please don't. 
Things may drive you crazy.

# HI,
This repository showcases the path I took to learn html-css. <br>
Feel free to clone, learn & use everything you find useful here. 

## ROADMAP!
Sorry, I can't provide you a roadmap to learn anything. <br>
Find your own path. 

## CSS3
I know, css is hard. <br>
Practice, practice and things will still be tough. <br>
But you will get your job done eventually. 

## HTML5
Easy to learn. <br>
Not so easy to remember semantic meaning of every element. <br>
So, don't memorize. I didn't. 

## GIVEUP
Please don't. <br>
Things may drive you crazy.
